# strava
Track, analyze, and model running statistics using Strava's API.

## Usage

### 1. Initialize the `StravaAPI` Class
Create an instance of the `StravaAPI` class by providing your `client_id`, `client_secret`, and optionally, an authorization `code`.

```python
from strava import StravaAPI

client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
code = "your_authorization_code"  # Optional

strava = StravaAPI(client_id, client_secret, code)
```

### 2. Obtain the Authorization Code
To get the authorization code, visit the URL generated by the `read_all_url` attribute of the class. This URL will prompt you to log in to your Strava account and authorize access.

```python
print(strava.read_all_url)
```

Click on the URL, log in, and authorize the app. You will be redirected to a URL containing the authorization code. Copy this code and pass it to the `StravaAPI` class. I.e.

```python
strava.code = "YOUR_RETURNED_CODE_HERE"
```

### 3. Connect to the API
Call the `connect` method to authenticate and retrieve the access token.

```python
strava.connect()
```

### 4. Pull Activity Data
Use the `pull_activity_data` method to fetch your activities. You can specify the number of activities to retrieve or use `'all'` to fetch all available activities.

```python
# Fetch all activities
strava.pull_activity_data(num_activities='all')

# Fetch a specific number of activities
strava.pull_activity_data(num_activities=50)
```

### 5. Access the Activities
The fetched activities will be stored in the `activies_list` attribute.

```python
activities = strava.activies_list
print(activities)
```

### Notes
- Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed: `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`.
- Replace placeholders like `your_client_id`, `your_client_secret`, and `your_authorization_code` with actual values from your Strava developer account.
